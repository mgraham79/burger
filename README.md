# Eat-da-Burger! App
### Summary
*Eat-da-Burger* is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. It starts out with a pre-defined list of choices, however if the user isn't interested in anything in that list, there is an input box that allows them to add any type of burger they want.

Once the user has found a burger they like, they can click on the "Devour It" button and it will move the selection out of the list of burgers.
